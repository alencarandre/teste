## Description

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
and it's an example app/project that you might work at Tiendanube, we wish you can show us your skills and your knowledge on these aspects.

The project is set up with a basic architecture so you can focus into the most important features.

## What we expect on this challenge:

- Features:
  - [x] Transcribe all components, than you find, from classes to functional in the Components folder.
  - [x] Implement a CR to handle **C**reate and **R**ead of the products persisting them into **Local Storage**.
  - [x] We wish you to identify component issues that are not well designed, and improve their reusability
  - [x] Use the icons library installed in the project in a component. [@tiendanube/icons](https://tiendanube.github.io/nimbus-icons/)

The CRUD have to follow these requirements:

- Must persist data with refresh (Local storage as mentioned above).
- Apply a State manager to handle the basic features (Mobx, Redux, Reflux, ContextAPI - Where you feel confortable, we wish to understand how you structure your logic)
- Validate and show input errors to prevent from submitting

You can add any library into the project, but we wish to evaluate how you create your own components

Not required but desireable:

- Jest knowledge, fix component errors.
- Any performance improvement, avoid multiple renders.
- Implement a DU to handle **D**elete and **U**pdate of the products persisting them into **Local Storage**.
- Design System improvements
